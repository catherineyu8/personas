	<h2>Goal</h2>
	<p>
		Coffee is a part of my every-day life. If I don't buy an oatmilk latte
		from a cafe, I am making a drink at home with my espresso machine and
		homemade syrup. How does my drink-making experience differ from that of
		a barista's? I explored different users' interactions and experiences
		with espresso machine interfaces by interviewing them and crafting
		personas based on my observations, ultimately aiming to
		<span class="accent-text"> tell a story of their experience</span> with
		espresso machines.

				The espresso machine is an interface used to
				<div class="accent-text">simplify and automate</div>
				the espresso-pulling process. Key components include:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Main control interface</b> - buttons, dials, knobs,
						pressure indicator, and temperature of an espresso brew,
						sometimes a touchscreen; controls the espresso-making
						process by responsively grinding beans, adjusting bean
						grinding settings, pulling a shot, and turning on/off
						the steam wand
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Portafilter and filter basket</b> - detachable
						accessories used to hold coffee grounds
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Steam wand</b> - produces steam to heat and froth
						milk
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Water reservoir</b> - holds water for the brewing and
						steaming process
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Drip tray</b> - catches fallen coffee grounds and
						water
					</li>
