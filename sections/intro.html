<h1>
	Better Brewing Experiences: Understanding User Interaction with Espresso
	Machine Interfaces

			>Coffee is a part of my every-day life. If I don't buy an iced
			vanilla oat latte from a cafe, I am making a homemade one with my
			espresso machine. How does my drink-making experience differ from
			that of a barista's? I explored different users' interactions and
			experiences with espresso machine interfaces by interviewing them
			and crafting personas based on my observations, ultimately aiming to
			tell a story of their experience with espresso machines.

		Key components include:
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Main control interface</b> - includes buttons, dials, knobs,
				indicators for pressure and temperature of an espresso brew,
				sometimes a touchscreen; controls the espresso-making process by
				responsively grinding beans, adjusting bean grinding settings,
				pulling a shot, and turning on/off the steam wand
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Portafilter and filter basket</b> - detachable accessories
				used to hold coffee grounds
			</li>
			<li><b>Steam wand</b> - produces steam to heat and froth milk</li>
			<li>
				<b>Water reservoir</b> - holds water for the brewing and
				steaming process
			</li>
			<li><b>Drip tray</b> - catches fallen coffee grounds and water</li>
