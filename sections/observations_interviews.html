	<p>
		I <span class="accent-text">observed</span> and
		<span class="accent-text">interviewed</span> baristas at local cafes, as
		well as home baristas, all using espresso machines to extract fresh
		espresso. I found that users encountered a wide range of experiences:
	</p>
</div>

<ul>
	<li>
		<b>Expectations</b> - some users expected it to be easy to use, while
		others were initially intimidated by the many features
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Uses</b> - baristas mainly used the espresso machine to make
		espresso-based drinks, using the steaming and hot water features to aid
		this process
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Frequency of use</b> - cafe baristas used the machine every few
		minutes or constantly, while home baristas use it around once per day
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Flow of use</b> - users moved fluidly throughout; home baristas were
		more careful on some steps while cafe baristas prioritized speed
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Difficulty</b> - basic features (eg pressing a button to extract
		espresso) were percieved as easy; some users found it hard to
		<u>understand</u>
		how additional features (eg adjusting the settings) contributed to
		making a <u>higher-quality espresso shot</u>
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Mistakes</b> - most mistakes made occurred during manual steps,
		causing the espresso to be over/under extracted; some users had issues
		with the water tank, which was easily fixed
	</li>
</ul>
