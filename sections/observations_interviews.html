			I went to local cafes and observed baristas as they navigated
			morning rush hours and slower moments throughout their shifts. I
			also interviewed home baristas, who used their own espresso machines
			to make a cafe-worthy drink-of-the-day.

	<h2>Key Observations:</h2>
</div>

<ul>
	<li>Move relatively fluidly throughout the entire process</li>
	<li>
		Some users tamped the coffee grounds and steamed milk effortlessly (both
		manual steps)
	</li>
	<li>
		Others took a longer time & more care to tamp, sometimes several times
	</li>
	<li>
		Use force to attach the portafilter to the machine and ensure it is
		locked in place
	</li>
	<li>
		After attaching the portafilter, quickly press the shot button to start
		the shot extraction
	</li>
	<li>
		Holds a hand under portafilter after shot extraction when removing the
		grounds, as the portafilter continues dripping occasionally
	</li>
	<li>
		Constantly wiping down parts of the machine such as the steam wand, drip
		tray
	</li>
</ul>

			1. What were your expectations on the difficulty level of using this

	</summary>
	<ul>
		<li>
			For a simpler espresso machine - thought it would be easy to use
		</li>
		<li>
			For a more complex espresso machine - initially intimidated -
			thought it would be challenging to learn the many controls/features
		</li>
		<li>Steep learning curve, but gets easier after practice</li>

			4. Can you describe the steps you take when using this machine?
		</div>
	</summary>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Check water level and amount of beans in grinder (refill either as

		</li>
		<li>Grind beans by pressing a button</li>
		<li>Tamp grounds (manual step)</li>
		<li>Attach portafilter to main machine body and lock in place</li>
		<li>Press a button or pull lever to extract espresso shot</li>
		<li>
			Steam milk (manual step) by turning steam wand on/off using a
			switch, clean wand by wiping down and purging leftover steam
		</li>
		<li>
			Empty portafilter - unlock it, dump out puck, rinse out using hot
			water function and wipe dry

		<li>Occasionally clean the machine - dump out/wash water reservoir</li>

			5. Is it easy or difficult to use this machine? What made it that
			way?
		</div>
	</summary>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Manual steps are hard to get correct, but gets easier to do with
			practice
		</li>
		<li>Very easy/intuitive to use the basic features of the interface</li>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Just press buttons, machine automates the espresso-making
				process
			</li>
			<li>
				Display helps provide feedback/monitor how well the drink is
				made (shot time/temp/pressure)

		<li>
			Additional features make it more complicated to understand + use

		<li>Some users - overwhelming to use the machine at first</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Unclear button labels</li>
			<li>Needed to read user manual to understand all the settings</li>

			6. Have you ever made a mistake when using the machine? If so, what
			happened, and how did you fix it?
		</div>
	</summary>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Generally, any mistakes made would result in adjusting some of the
			machine settings and having to restart the entire espresso-making
			process
		</li>
		<li>Mistakes included:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Grinding an incorrect amount of coffee</li>
			<li>
				Portafilter not locked in, it popped out and coffee sprayed
				everywhere
			</li>
			<li>Overfilled water tank - machine wouldn't start</li>
			<li>
				Not enough water in the tank, machine made horrible noise and
				didn't extract a shot
			</li>
			<li>
				Mistakes were common during the manual process, such as
				extracting a bad shot or incorrectly steaming milk
			</li>

			7. Was there ever a time when the machine didn't work as expected?
			What did you do?
		</div>
	</summary>
	<ul>
		<li>Some users - no problems at all</li>
		<li>Water doesn't come out of machine at all</li>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Test all the different water features, look up the issue online
			</li>
			<li>
				Fix - take out water filter + dump out water, attach filter
				first before refilling tank
			</li>
			<li>Another fix - properly lock water reservoir into place</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Improper shot</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Due to incorrect manual steps with grind size/tamping</li>
			<ul>
				<li>
					If shot under extracted (according to display) → adjust dial
					to a finer grind
				</li>
				<li>
					If shot over extracted (according to display) → adjust dial
					to a coarser grind
				</li>
			</ul>
			<li>
				Espresso flowed too fast - would ideally like to increase
				extraction time, but instead (due to machine setting
				limitations) sets grind finer
			</li>
		</ul>
