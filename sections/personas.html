<h2>Creating Personas</h2>
<p>
	I created <span class="accent-text">two characters</span> based on my
	observations: one reflects
	<span class="accent-text">less experienced users</span> mainly using the
	preset settings to make espresso-based drinks that still taste like they was
	made expertly in a cafe, the other reflects
	<span class="accent-text">experienced users</span> who want quickly to
	produce quality espresso and have a deeper understanding of the complexities
	that make up a good espresso.
