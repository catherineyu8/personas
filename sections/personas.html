			Based on the observations and interview responses, I determined two
			main types of user experience with espresso machines. Some users
			effortlessly perform all the steps of extracting an espresso shot,
			while others move a little more unsurely. To better capture these
			perspectives, I crafted two user personas to represent these types
			of users.

			They understand many of the underlying complexities that go into
			making a good espresso shot, and aim to consistently and efficiently
			pull high-quality espresso shots. Their performance is limited by
			the lack of customization over controls such as extraction pressure
			and time on a standard espresso machine used at home.

			This persona reflects the frequent, experienced users of the
			espresso machine. They also want quickly to produce quality
			espresso, but understand the complexities that make up a good shot
