<h2>Crafting a Story</h2>
<p>
	Personas help us <span class="accent-text">understand</span> who users are,
	but storyboarding goes one step further and
	<span class="accent-text">brings their experiences to life</span>. I created
	a storyboard for a home barista to
	<span class="accent-text">better understand</span> the challenges they face,
	how they act, and what they experience throughout their interactions with an
	espresso machine
